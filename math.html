<h1> Math </h1>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"> Dover High School Math Team</h2>

<p>In November 2024, I became a coach of the Math Team at Dover High School. This was our first year as a math team after our former math team disbanded shortly before its original coach retired. In the 2024-2025 school year, our team competed in only one competition: the <a href="https://www.nhmathteachers.org/NHTM/NHTI-State-Math-Contest">New Hampshire State Math Contest</a>. Despite having significantly less planning time and meet experience than other schools, the students at Dover High placed third in the Large division.</p>

<p>This year (2025-2026), the Dover High School Math Team is competing in the Tri-State Math League. The students compete in monthly meets with topics that rotate every month. In March 2026, they will return to NHTI in Concord, NH, for the New Hampshire State Math Contest.</p>

<p>I was hesitant to take on this position at Dover High School because I have always felt unsure about contest mathematics. I have always seen math as a very collaborative endeavor, and I thought that competing in math contests was the very opposite of collaboration, but a year of working with the Dover High School Math Team has completely changed my mind. I love this position because I get to watch my students teach each other and collaborate on difficult and beautiful mathematics problems and because I love seeing their excitement about learning new things and succeeding at challenging tasks.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Senior Thesis</h2>

<p>In Spring 2024, I completed a Senior Thesis about Complex Analysis with Dr. Rita Hibschweiler at the University of New Hampshire. The thesis is titled "The Generalized Composition Operator J on Bloch Spaces", and it studies a space of functions that are analytic on the open unit disk and an operator on that space.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Pi Mu Epsilon Mathematics Honor Society</h2>

<p>During my time at the University of New Hampshire, I was a member of the <a href="https://pme-math.org/">Pi Mu Epsilon</a> New Hampshire Alpha chapter. This is a group to celebrate the study of mathematics and to recognize successful mathematics students.</p>

<p>In the New Hampshire Alpha Chapter, our two major events. In the Fall, we held Exploring Math Night, where we invited a panel of speakers to talk to students about getting careers in fields involving mathematics. In the Spring, we volunteered at the <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/node/277643">Seacoast Region MATHCOUNTS Competition</a>, a math competition for local middle schoolers held at UNH.</p>
